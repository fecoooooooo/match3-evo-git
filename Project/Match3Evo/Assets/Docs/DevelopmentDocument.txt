- Random in game
The game sets Random.Seed based on Skillz first random value.
This means that to maintain the fair gameplay you pregenerate a lot of blocks to refill the game board,
or you dont use Random for other than generating the new rows.
Other solution if you replace the use of Unity.Random to an other solution.

- Shared containers between functions in BoardManager
These containers are created to hold temporary state of calculations.
They have to be used frequently and this is a performance consideration.
Make sure to understand their purpose, and lifetime pefor using them.

- By default the tutorial pointer is over the magnet we just turn it on when only the magnet can be used in game.
	If you want to change the position of the pointer implement the positioning.

- GameManager can be used in the Game scene for quick testing. If it is present, then you can start the game as from the menu.
Check in TutorialGame if you want to start the tutorial instead.
Just do not leave the GameManager in the Game scene!
